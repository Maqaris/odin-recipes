    <ul>
      <li>Light olive oil</li>
      <li>Boneless lean beef, cut into small chunks</li>
      <li>Bay leaves</li>
      <li>Fresh garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>Dried chilli flakes</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Tomato paste</li>
      <li>Beef broth</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme sprigs</li>
      <li>
        All-purpose flour - Mix the flour in a few tablespoons of water to make

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by sautéing the beef chunks in olive oil in your instant pot
        (medium heat). Fry the beef until it starts turning brown and shiny.
        This step will take between eight to ten minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then add the rest of the ingredients except the flour, deglaze the pot,
        and pressure cook for twelve minutes. Release the steam after five
        minutes and open the pot. Discard the thyme and bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour slurry and stir it into the pot. Cook the stew on sauté
        until the liquid thickens (about two to three minutes only), and your
        beautiful, peppery beef stew is ready to be served.
      </li>
