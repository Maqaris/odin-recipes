    <h2>
      Tandoori gobi makes for a healthy and tasty evening snack or appetizer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you like spicy vegetarian snacks, do try this tandoori gobi made in the
      oven. Normally, anything 'tandoori' is made in a tandoor, a clay oven.
      However, since we don't have access to a tandoor in our home kitchens, our
      regular oven does the work.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cauliflower - a medium-sized head, cut into small florets</li>
      <li>
        Thick yogurt - do not use vanilla flavored or sweetened yogurt for
        Indian recipes that call for yogurt. Use plain, natural, and preferably
        full fat yogurt for maximum taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chickpea flour (besan) - a fine yellow flour, it is easily available in
        Indian stores or in the international aisle of any supermarket. It gives
        a crispy texture and nutty flavor to the tandoori gobi.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ginger garlic paste - use store bought or make your own. It's so easy to
        make some! Put equal quantities of peeled ginger and garlic in a
        blender, add a few tablespoons water and whiz until you have a smooth
        paste. Use as required and store the excess in a clean glass bottle with
        a lid in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>Lemon juice - freshly squeezed</li>
      <li>Cooking oil - any neutral oil will do</li>
      <li>Turmeric - good ol' turmeric for color and warmth</li>
      <li>
        Red chilli powder - use cayenne if you have it but reduce the quantity
        if you don't want very spicy cauliflower. Or use a mild variety of
        chilli powder called Kashmiri chilli. It adds colour without much heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garam masala - the most commonly used spice blend in Indian cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cumin powder - make your own cumin powder if you don't have ground
        cumin. Dry roast a couple of teaspoons cumin seeds in a small frypan
        until the seeds change color slightly and become fragrant. Let the seeds
        cool down a bit and grind to a powder (as coarse or fine as you like it)
        in a spice grinder or clean coffee grinder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chaat masala - this spice blend is available easily in Indian stores. It
        lends a lipsmacking piquancy to anything it's added to.
      </li>
      <li>Salt - everything tastes better with a little salt, right?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the cauliflower into florets and wash under running tap water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour water in a pot and bring it to a roiling boil. Add the cauliflower
        florets and allow them to cook for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take out the florets and keep them aside. You can do this in two ways:
        either take them out with the help of a slotted spoon or drain all the
        water from the pot in a colander and keep the cauliflower aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put all the batter ingredients (from the yogurt to the salt) in a bowl
        and whisk to make a thick and smooth batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the batter on the cauliflower florets or dip the florets in the
        batter and shake off the excess batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray a baking tray with some cooking oil and place the cauliflower on
        the tray in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>Roast in a preheated oven at 400 Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        In the end, switch the oven setting to broil and allow the cauli to
        remain in the oven for 4-5 minutes. Remove from the oven when the
        florets start getting brown spots on the top.
      </li>
    </ol>
